# Lambda
Lambda is AWS's serverless compute service.

**What it does:**

- **Run code without servers** - Upload your function, AWS handles everything else
- **Event-driven** - Automatically executes in response to triggers (S3 upload, API call, schedule, etc.)
- **Scales automatically** - Handles 1 request or 10,000 simultaneously
- **Pay per execution** - Charged only for compute time used, down to 100ms increments
- **Supports multiple languages** - Python, Node.js, Java, Go, C#, Ruby, etc.
